# SLIP
Project-Sign Language 
This project was developed with the Idea of
helping the deaf and mute people with advancing tech of artificialintelligence. This project was derived from my older project of Facial-recognition
Which works to detect the face from the frame and signifies the result
accordingly . It was also able to detect the number of faces in particular
single frame. After that We wanted to learn more on this field and explore what are
the different things we can achieve from it.With the motive of helping
people “SLIP” was created that includes enhanced tech like deeplearning and NLP(natural language processing)
